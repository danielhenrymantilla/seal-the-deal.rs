# ðŸ¦­ `::seal-the-deal` ðŸ¦­

Attribute to use on the `trait` methods (or associated functions) that you wish to "seal", a.k.a.,
render them `final`.

**It will be impossible for implementors to override the default implementation of that
function.**

# Example

```rust
use ::seal_the_deal::with_seals;

#[with_seals]
trait SomeTrait {
    /// Shall always return `42`.
    #[sealed]
    fn some_method(&self) -> i32 {
        42
    }
}
```

Attempting to override the default impl shall result in a compile error:

```rust ,compile_fail
use ::seal_the_deal::with_seals;

#[with_seals]
trait SomeTrait {
    /// Shall always return `42`.
    #[sealed]
    fn some_method(&self) -> i32 {
        42
    }
}

struct Evil;

impl SomeTrait for Evil {
    fn some_method(&self) -> i32 {
        eprintln!("**manic laughter**");
        27
    }
}
```

with:

```rust ,compile_fail
# /*
error[E0195]: lifetime parameters or bounds on method `some_method` do not match the trait declaration
  --> src/_lib.rs:61:19
   |
10 |     #[sealed]
   |       ------ lifetimes in impl do not match this method in trait
...
19 |     fn some_method(&self) -> i32 {
   |                   ^ lifetimes do not match method in trait
error: aborting due to 1 previous error
# */ compile_error!("");
```

# Implementation a.k.a. the macro secret magic sauce ðŸ§™

<details class="custom"><summary><span class="summary-box"><span>Click to show</span></span></summary>

```rust
use ::seal_the_deal::with_seals;

#[with_seals]
pub trait SomeTrait {
    /// Shall always return `42`.
    #[sealed]
    fn some_method(&self) -> i32 {
        42
    }
}
```

expands to:

```rust
mod __SomeTraità¶žseal_the_deal {
    pub trait Seal<'__> {}
    impl Seal<'_> for () {}
}

pub trait SomeTrait {
    /// Shall always return `42`.
    fn some_method<'sealed>(&self) -> i32
    where
        () : __SomeTraità¶žseal_the_deal::Seal<'sealed>,
    {
        42
    }
}
```

This approach does effectively and nicely seal that method, preventing it from being overridden:

  - since the clause is trivially implemented for for at least one lifetime (in practice all of
    them), callers are not hindered by it.

      - underspecified lifetime params are fine, they do not cause "inference ambiguity errors";
      - this clause is `dyn`-compatible!
      - since the method stays in the actual trait, it remains visible in the docs;
          - a `() : Sealed<'seal>` will be visible, which is rather low-noise w.r.t. the semantics
            involved.

  - and yet the clause appears to be complex/convoluted enough for Rust not to allow skipping it,
    hence the "lifetime mismatch" when people attempt to do actual impls.

  - technically-speaking, it is possible for a same-module or submodule-thereof to have enough
    visibility of `__SomeTraità¶žseal_the_deal::Sealed` to be able to repeat, _verbatim_, the clause.
    This ought to be fine since:

      - there is a `à¶ž` in that path!!

      - same-crate code is not really the threat/adversarial model, here, but rather, external code
        (be it for Semver or `unsafe`ty reasons).

      - if this were really deemed a problem, the user could then just further encapsulate the whole
        thing in a helper private `mod`ule:

        ```rust
        pub use paranoid::SomeTrait;
        mod paranoid {
            use super::*;

            #[::seal_the_deal::with_seals]
            pub trait SomeTrait {
                /// Shall always return `42`.
                #[sealed]
                fn some_method(&self) -> i32 {
                    42
                }
            }
        }
        ```

# Alternative

<details class="custom"><summary><span class="summary-box"><span>Click to show</span></span></summary>

The usual approach to have a sealed/`final` method like that is through a blanket-implemented super
`trait` (a.k.a, the "super extension trait").

```rust
trait Trait : FinalMethodsOfTrait {
    /* non-final methods here */
}

trait FinalMethodsOfTrait {
    /// Shall always return `42`.
    fn method(&self) -> i32 {
        42
    }
}

impl<T : ?Sized + Trait> FinalMethodsOfTrait for T {}
```

But this approach has _two_ problems:

  - documentation-wise, it is ugly: the final `.method()` is no longer discoverable on the page
    for `Trait`.

  - Whilst both properly-`Trait`-bounded generic parameters and `dyn Trait`s do let one very
    ergonomically call `.method()` in a blissfully oblivious-to-the-super-extension-trait way, it
    turns out that _concrete_ implementors do not let one perform such ergonomic calls directly: the
    super extension trait is expected to be in scope for the method call to succeed, totally
    shattering, imho, the illusion and magic of the pattern.

    ```rust ,compile_fail
    mod lib {
        pub trait Trait : FinalMethodsOfTrait {
            /* non-final methods here */
        }

        pub trait FinalMethodsOfTrait {
            /// Shall always return `42`.
            fn method(&self) -> i32 {
                42
            }
        }

        impl<T : ?Sized + Trait> FinalMethodsOfTrait for T {}
    }

    use lib::Trait;

    struct Foo;

    impl Trait for Foo {}

    Foo.method(); // Error, `FinalMethodsOfTrait` not in scope! ðŸ˜­
    ```

    Error message:

    ```rust ,compile_fail
    # /*
    error[E0599]: no method named `method` found for struct `Foo` in the current scope
      --> src/_lib.rs:136:5
